## About
Foxes are swift and wily. Breeze through your projects with Taskfox, your personal productivity app.

Taskfox is a front-end single-page web application powered by JavaScript. Users can define Projects and add Tasks to their Projects.

The user can create new Projects and Tasks, edit Projects and Tasks, delete Projects and Tasks, and toggle the complete state of Tasks.

* Actions:
    * toggle Project complete 
    * check Project overdue status
    * set Project to overdue
    * check Task overdue status
    * set Task to overdue

* Data formatting:
    * Standardise all date formatting throughout app

* Styles:
    * harmonise styles across all features
